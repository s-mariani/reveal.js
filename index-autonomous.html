                <p> According to [Maturana and Varela, 1980]: </p>

                <p> <em>in the domain of systems biology,
                    autonomous systems acquire the property of specifying their own rules of behaviour, do not work
                    as mere transducers or functions for converting input instructions into output products, and are
                    themselves sources of their own activity</em> </p>

            </section>
            <section>

                <p> From [Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap FY 2011-2036]: </p>
                <p> <em>systems are self-directed toward a <strong>goal</strong> in that they do not require outside control, but rather are
                    governed by laws and strategies that direct their behavior</em> </p>
                <p class="fragment"> <em>These control algorithms are created and tested by teams of human operators and
                    software developers. However, if <em>machine learning</em>
                    is utilized, autonomous systems can develop modified strategies for themselves by which
                    they select their behavior</em> </p>

                <h3> Autonomy in software agents </h3>


                <p> Agents can decide to autonomously activate towards the pursuing of the
                    goal, without the need of any specific event or solicitation: </p>
                <p class="fragment"> <strong>proactivity</strong> is a sort of extreme expression of autonomy </p>

            </section>
            <section>

                <p> Clearly, it is not always black and white, as modern objects have features
                    that can make objects resemble agents </p>
                <p> In effect, several systems for "agent-oriented programming" can be considered simply as advanced
                    tools for object-oriented programming or for more dynamic forms of service-oriented programming </p>

                <h3> Artificial intelligence perspective </h3>

                <p> For many researchers, agents do not simply have to be goal-oriented,
                    autonomous, situated, but they have to be <em>"intelligent"</em>, that typically means they have to
                    integrate "artificial intelligence" tools: neural networks, logic-based reasoning, conversational
                    capabilities (interact via natural language), ...  </p>

            </section>
            <section>

                <p> Treating a program as if it is intelligent ("the program <em>wants</em> the input
                    in a different format") is called the <strong>intentional stance</strong>, and it's helpful to us as programmers
                    to think this way </p>
                <p class="fragment"> The intentional stance leads us to program agents at the knowledge level (Newell),
                    that means reasoning about programs in terms of: </p>
                <small><ul class="fragment">
                    <li> facts and <strong>beliefs</strong> (rather than variables and data) </li>
                    <li> goals and <strong>intentions</strong> (rather than functionalities and methods) </li>
                    <li> <strong>desires</strong> and preferences </li>
                </ul></small>

            </section>
            <section>

                <p> A possible definition of intelligence is: </p>
                <p class="fragment"> <em>"the capability to act purposefully towards the achievement of goals"</em> </p>
                <p class="fragment"> Hence for an agent to <em>be regarded (observed) as</em> being intelligent it is enough
                    simply to know how to achieve a given goal, which implies some sort of <strong>reasoning</strong> </p>

                        <li class="fragment"> Actions: increase / decrease temperature </li>
                        <li class="fragment"> Reasoning: <span><pre><code data-trim>

                    <li class="fragment"> Differently from game theory, let's now assume that agents can interact: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment"> <em>Direct</em> interactions: agents directly communicate with each other by exchanging messages </li>
                        <li class="fragment"> <em>Indirect</em> (or stigmergic) interactions: agents interact indirectly by accessing
                            an environment in which they situate (physical or computational or mixed) </li>
                        <li class="fragment"> As they have a mean to affect each other's actions and beliefs, they can strategically act
                            based on what the other agents do (observation), and agree on common courses of actions </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment"> Interactions may imply: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment"> <em>Communication</em>: explicit exchange of beliefs, desires, intentions, ... </li>

                <ul>

                        application goals, and trust each other because they know they work towards the same goal </li>
                    <li class="fragment"> <em>Competitive</em>: agents are forced to interact to achieve individual goals, but
                        they don't have to trust each other </li>
                    <li class="fragment"> <em>Collaborative competition</em>: agents compete but for the sake of achieving
                        some global goal, hence they trust each other </li>

                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment"> In distributed algorithms, too, there is need of reaching agreement on how to
                        act or on a common perspective of the world (leader election, mutual exclusion, validation of a
                        blockchain transaction, etc.) </li>
                    <li class="fragment"> However, there is no concept such as "goal", "utility" of actions, etc.: either
                        the algorithms works, or fails </li>

                        how to reach agreement </li>
                    <li class="fragment"> Stigmergic interactions: the form and structure of the "signs" in the environment,

                    <li class="fragment"> In this context, agents should abide to the "rules of the game", and their
                        strategy regards freedom in deciding what to do at each step of the protocol (amongst admissible actions) </li>
